LLM Writing Assistant Backend

This FastAPI application serves as the backend for the LLM Writing Assistant.
It provides an endpoint that simulates LLM-based text improvements and corrections.

Students are expected to expand this template by:
1. Implementing actual Ollama integration
2. Enhancing the text processing logic
3. Adding additional endpoints as needed
